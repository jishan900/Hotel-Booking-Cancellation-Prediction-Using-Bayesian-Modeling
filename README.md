Research Question: Can we accurately predict hotel booking cancellations and identify key factors influencing cancellation using Bayesian Models?

Focused on: Predictive Booking Model:
Implement a Bayesian model that predicts the likelihood of a successful booking based on variables such as lead time, number of adults and children, 
weekend and week nights, room type, and special requests. Use historical data to train the model and continuously update it to enhanceÂ accuracy.
