Research Question: Can we accurately predict hotel booking cancellations and identify key factors influencing cancellation using Bayesian Models?

Focused on: Predictive Booking Model:
Implement a Bayesian model that predicts the likelihood of a successful booking based on variables such as lead time, number of adults and children, 
weekend and week nights, room type, and special requests. Use historical data to train the model and continuously update it to enhance accuracy.     


After that, Customer Satisfaction Analysis:
Apply Bayesian analytics to assess customer satisfaction by analyzing feedback and preferences. Use variables like type of meal, car parking space 
availability, and room type to identify patterns that contribute to positive experiences. Implement strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and encourage repeat bookings.


# Need to change variables name in JN.
# Need to use plot for visualizations. V.V.I
