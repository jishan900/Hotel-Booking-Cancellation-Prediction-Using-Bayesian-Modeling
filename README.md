Research Question: Can we accurately predict hotel booking cancellations and identify key factors influencing cancellation using Bayesian Models?

Focused on: Predictive Booking Model:
Implement a Bayesian model that predicts the likelihood of a successful booking based on variables such as lead time, number of adults and children, 
weekend and week nights, room type, and special requests. Use historical data to train the model and continuously update it to enhance accuracy.     


# We had total (36285, 17) - (observations, features) in the dataset. But, due to a lack of computing power, we reduced it and selected (10000, 17) data.  



# Bayesian models need to be implemented: 
**Binomial-Beta Model, Negative-Binomial-Beta Model**, **Poisson-Gamma Model, Exponential-Gamma Model,** **GLM**, Normal-Normal Model, Multinomial-Dirichlet Model, Nomal-Inv.Gamma Model, Normal-Normal Model (Special case: Linear
Regression), Normal-Inverse Gamma Model, Hierarchical binomial model, Finite Mixture-Models, Data-driven non-linear models. 
**Need to modify later for full datsaet.**  **5 models done**


# Further step:
1. Negative-Binomial-Beta Model**, **Poisson-Gamma Model, [Need to choose 1]
2. Data analysis, prior, details about the method, results. 



# ML models need to be implemented: 
RandomForestClassifier, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree Classifier, SVC then Models Comparison, CatBoostClassifier, XGBRFClassifier, XGBRFClassifier.
